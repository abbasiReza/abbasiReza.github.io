I am Reza Abbasi, a dedicated researcher passionate about advancing machine learning through innovative research and real-world applications. My academic and professional experiences focus on areas such as vision-language modeling, out-of-distribution generalization, and self-supervised learning.

I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/), graduating with a perfect 4.00/4.00 GPA. My thesis, supervised by [Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/), explored self-supervised models for medical image retrieval. I hold a Bachelor of Science from [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/), where I worked on meta-heuristic methods for path planning.

My research interests include:
- Vision-language models  
- Self-supervised learning  
- Out-of-distribution generalization  
- Medical imaging applications

I am especially interested in compositional generalization and how it can enhance the robustness and interpretability of multimodal systems.

I have contributed to several collaborative research efforts. As a Research Assistant at the [Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab](https://rohban-lab.github.io/), I worked on advanced computer vision systems and mentored junior researchers. At the [Machine Learning Lab at SUT](http://mll.ce.sharif.edu/), I conducted extensive studies on contrastive and CLIP-based models for visual and textual understanding.
