I am Reza Abbasi, a dedicated researcher passionate about pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence through innovative research and practical applications. My academic journey and professional focus center on cutting-edge areas of machine learning, particularly vision-language models, out-of-distribution generalization, and self-supervised learning.

Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/), I have maintained an exceptional academic record with a perfect 4.00/4.00 GPA. Under the guidance of [Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/), my thesis explores self-supervised models for medical image retrieval, building upon my previous academic foundation at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/), where I completed my Bachelor of Science and conducted research on meta-heuristic methods for robot path planning.

My research encompasses several interconnected domains:
- Vision-language models
- Self-supervised learning
- Out-of-distribution generalization
- Medical imaging applications

I am particularly intrigued by the potential of compositional generalization in multimodal systems, driving my exploration of innovative machine learning approaches.

Throughout my academic career, I have been actively involved in impactful research initiatives. As a Research Assistant at the [Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab](https://rohban-lab.github.io/), I developed advanced computer vision models and mentored undergraduate students. At the [Machine Learning Lab at SUT](http://mll.ce.sharif.edu/), I conducted extensive experiments on CLIP-based vision-language systems. My collaborative work at [Shahid Beheshti University](https://en.sbu.ac.ir/) further expanded my expertise in applying self-supervised learning techniques to medical imaging.


For a comprehensive overview of my academic and research journey, I invite you to review my [CV](https://github.com/abbasiReza/assets/pdf/Reza_Abbasi_CV.pdf) and explore my [Publications](https://github.com/abbasiReza/publications).
