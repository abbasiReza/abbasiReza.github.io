I am Reza Abbasi, a passionate researcher with a strong focus on Vision-Language Models, Out-of-Distribution Generalization, and Self-Supervised Learning. I am deeply interested in advancing AI through innovative research and impactful applications.

I am completing my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology (SUT)](https://www.sharif.edu/), with a perfect GPA of 4.00/4.00. My thesis focuses on self-supervised models for medical image retrieval, supervised by Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from [Isfahan University of Technology (IUT)](https://english.iut.ac.ir/), where my thesis explored meta-heuristic methods for robot path planning.

My research interests include **vision-language models**, **Out Of Distribution Generalization**, **self-supervised learning**, and **medical imaging applications**. I am also curious about exploring compositional generalization in multimodal systems.

I have contributed as a Research Assistant at the [Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab](https://ce.sharif.edu/), where I developed advanced computer vision models and mentored undergraduate students. Additionally, at the [Machine Learning Lab at SUT](https://ce.sharif.edu/), I conducted experiments and analyses on CLIP-based vision-language systems. At [Shahid Beheshti University](https://en.sbu.ac.ir/), I collaborated on a multidisciplinary project applying self-supervised learning to medical imaging.

My work has been published at prestigious venues such as **[EECV](https://eccv.ecva.net/)**, **[ECAI](https://www.ecai2024.eu/)**, and **[Journal of Endodontics](https://www.jendodon.com/)**. Key projects include histopathology retrieval using CLIP, evaluations on compositional generalization benchmarks, and object detection with YOLO and OWL-ViT.
